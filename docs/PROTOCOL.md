# Cadence wire protocol — v1

The control API is newline-delimited JSON over a Unix-domain socket at
`<state_dir>/cadence.sock`. Each line is one request; the daemon answers
with one line per request on the same connection. Multiple requests may
share a connection.

State directory: `$CADENCE_STATE_DIR`, else `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cadence`,
else `~/.local/state/cadence` (mode 0700). The daemon accepts only
same-UID peers (`SO_PEERCRED`). This establishes same-user access; it is
not a hostile same-user isolation boundary.

One daemon owns a state directory: `serve` takes an exclusive `flock` on
`<state_dir>/cadence.lock` before touching the store or socket and holds
it for the process lifetime. A second start fails `rejected` without
running recovery; `daemon start` reports `already_running` with the
existing daemon's health.

## Frames

Request: `{"method": "<name>", "params": {...}}`

Response: `{"ok": true, "result": {...}}` or
`{"ok": false, "error": {"kind": "rejected|provider|unknown|internal", "message": "..."}}`

Error kinds:

- `rejected` — invalid or disallowed request; nothing was attempted.
- `provider` — the provider explicitly rejected the request.
- `unknown` — transport failed after the request may have reached the
  provider. The attempt is preserved for review; never retried blindly.
- `internal` — local runtime failure (I/O, storage, protocol).

## Methods

| Method | Params | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `health` | — | `{state:"ready", protocol:1, capabilities:[...]}` |
| `shutdown` | — | `{state:"stopping"}`; daemon stops actors (bounded) then exits |
| `agent_register` | `alias, provider, cwd, endpoint_kind?, role?, sandbox?, instructions?` | `{alias,state:"starting",provider}` |
| `agent_list` | — | `{agents:[Agent]}` |
| `agent_show` | `alias` | `{agent, messages, event_cursor}` |
| `agent_send` | `alias, text, message?, reply_to?` | `{message,state,duplicate}` |
| `agent_ask` | `alias, text, message?, wait?` | the `Message` row; state may be non-terminal if `wait` expired |
| `agent_events` | `alias, after, wait(<=30)` | `{events:[Event], cursor}` |
| `agent_requests` | `alias` | `{requests:[{request,method,params}]}` |
| `agent_respond` | `alias, request, decision?|answers?` | `{state:"answered"}` |
| `agent_stop` | `alias` | `{alias,state:"stopped"|"attention"}` |
| `agent_resume` | `alias` | `{alias,state:"starting"|"attention"}` |

`alias`, `provider`, `message` ids: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`.
`text`: 1–48000 chars. `reply_to` may not equal `alias`.

`agent_stop` is bounded: it interrupts the provider, waits a short grace
(~3s), then force-closes the transport and joins the actor — the bound
also covers provider initialization, since the adapter is published
before `open`. A turn that was still in flight becomes `unknown` and the
agent stays `attention` — a stop never masks a fence: on an agent already
in `attention` it only disables and preserves the state and reason. While
a stop is in flight the alias stays reserved: `agent_resume` is
`rejected` until the stop's final write is done, and a second
`agent_stop` is `rejected` (`already stopping`) before any mutation —
a stale stop cannot write over a new actor generation. A sequential
stop after completion is idempotent. Resume on a fenced agent returns
`attention` and does not re-enable.

## Agents

`endpoint_kind` selects the delivery mechanism; reachable message states
depend on it:

| endpoint_kind | delivery | status |
|---|---|---|
| `managed` | owned provider process (JSON-RPC stdio) | implemented: provider `codex` |
| `managed-ws` | owned `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:*`; official TUI attachable | implemented: provider `codex` |
| `fake` | in-process test double | test fixture only |
| `pty` | terminal paste/capture | declared, not implemented |
| `native_inbox` | provider-native inbox | declared, not implemented |

`managed-ws` runs the same app-server protocol as `managed`, over a
loopback WebSocket instead of stdio. The agent record exposes `endpoint`
(`ws://127.0.0.1:<port>`) while the actor is alive; an official Codex
TUI attaches to the same native thread with:

```
codex resume --remote <endpoint> <thread_id>
```

(`cadence agent attach <alias>` prints this command; `--run` executes it
in the current terminal.) A fresh `managed-ws` thread is seeded with one
minimal turn at open — Codex only persists a thread's rollout after its
first turn, and `resume --remote` fails on an unseeded thread. The
endpoint is cleared when the actor exits, so a printed command never
points at a dead address; attaching to a `stopped`/`offline` or non-WS
agent is `rejected`. Terminal echo of a submitted prompt is visibility,
not receipt — message state remains authoritative.

Trust boundary, stated plainly: the endpoint is an unauthenticated
loopback port reachable by ANY local user — `SO_PEERCRED` does not
apply to TCP, and the port is discoverable via `ss`. The URL lives only
in the private 0700 state dir, but treat every local process as able to
connect. Do not expose `managed-ws` on multi-user hosts you distrust.

The wire is tungstenite with a single I/O owner: only one thread ever
touches the `WebSocket`, and outbound payloads (requests, pongs, close
replies) travel over a channel it drains between bounded reads — no two
writers ever share the socket. Connect, handshake, writes, and close
are bounded: the upgrade runs against an absolute deadline (a
drip-feeding or silent peer fails startup within the connect deadline)
and the owned child is killed — `stop` can interrupt setup because the
child is published before the transport connects.

Approval requests remain brokered through `agent_respond`; an attached
TUI may also see and answer them. The provider then emits
`serverRequest/resolved`; Cadence drops the matching pending handle,
emits `input_resolved`, keeps any other pending requests, and a late
`agent_respond` on the consumed handle is `rejected`. Nothing is ever
auto-accepted by Cadence.

Agent states: `starting → idle ⇄ busy → waiting_input →` and terminal-ish
`attention | stopping → stopped | offline`. `attention` means an uncertain
provider outcome needs human review; the actor will not relaunch itself.

## Messages

States: `queued → submitting → running → completed | failed | interrupted
| unknown`. `unknown` is durable and fences its actor. Any ambiguous
post-submission outcome lands there — transport loss mid-turn, a turn
deadline, an acknowledged `turn/start` that cannot be correlated to a
turn id, an unclassifiable completion status, or a forced close while a
turn was in flight.

Idempotency: a client-supplied `message` id makes retries of the *same
envelope* (alias+body+reply_to+source) return `duplicate:true`. The same
id with different content is a `rejected` conflict.

Result routing: when a message has `reply_to`, finishing it enqueues a
`worker_result` message to that agent in the SAME transaction. The routed
id is `uuid5("cadence-result:" + message_id)` (deterministic; resend is a
no-op) and carries no `reply_to`, so routing cannot loop.

## Events

`agent_events` pages the durable log: `{seq, alias, kind, payload, at}`.
Kinds: `registered, queued, submitting, turn_started, turn_finished,
provider_event, input_required, input_answered, input_resolved,
result_routed, ready, attention, stop_requested`. `wait>0` long-polls
up to 30s.

## Approvals

Provider-initiated requests (e.g. `item/commandExecution/requestApproval`,
`item/tool/requestUserInput`, `session/request_permission`) pause the
agent at `waiting_input` and appear in `agent_requests`. `agent_respond`
answers them per type; nothing is auto-accepted. A request may also be
resolved outside Cadence — an attached TUI answering the approval makes
the provider emit `serverRequest/resolved`, which drops the pending
handle (`input_resolved`); a late `agent_respond` is then `rejected`.
The agent stays `waiting_input` while other requests remain pending.

## Recovery

On daemon start: messages in `submitting`/`running` become `unknown` and
their agents `offline`/`attention`. Enabled agents relaunch *unless*
fenced by an `unknown` attempt — those stay `attention` for review.
